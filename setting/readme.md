# Docker for PintOS
PintOS is one of the well-known simple operating system framework for 80x86, developed by Stanford.
However, in this point of the view, this framework relies on some outdated dependencies, that makes difficult us to compile at modern operating systems.
This repository will build you a docker container to provide easier and safer environment for your PintOS project.

## Build
To build the container, type the following commands:
```bash
docker build -t [image_name]
```
